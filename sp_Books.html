        <h1>Favorite Books and Series</h1>
        <p>I love to read books when I have free time. I love to read YA (young adult) fiction, fantasy, science fiction,
            and anything about vampires (except Twilight). Below are a few of my favorite books/series. You can click on each 
            picture to see the full synopsis of each book/series on Goodreads and read reviews.

                <p class="card-text">The Six of Crows duology consists of Six of Crows and Crooked Kingdom. They are written by Leigh Bardugo. 
                    The world in these books is called 
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://edm.com/">GrishaVerse.</a> 
                    Leigh Bardugo is also my top favorite author. The Six of Crows duology are YA fantasy books. This duology 
                    follows 6 main characters who go on a journey to do an impossible heist that will reward them with a lot of 
                    money if they succeed.

                <h5 class="card-title">The Hate U Give</h5>
                <p class="card-text">The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas is a YA contemporary that follows the main character Starr Carter. 
                    Starr witnesses her childhood friend get shot by a police officer. This book is one of my favorites 
                    because I love the family dynamics. I also love that this book is #ownvoices, meaning that the author is either 
                    the same ethnicity or has the same disorders as the main character. In this case, Angie Thomas ia african-american 
                    and so is the main character. This book is so important and teaches readers that you have a voice and it is important. 
                    The Hate U Give is being adapted into a movie and you can watch the trailer

                <h5 class="card-title">Percy Jackson and the Olympians</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Percy Jackson and the Olympians is a 5-book series by Rick Riordan. It is a middle-grade fantasy. 
                    The first book is titled <u>The Lightning Thief</u>. This series is heavily influenced by Greek mythology which 
                    is one of the many reasons it is one of my favorite series. Percy Jackson as a main character is funny and sassy. 
                    Fun fact: Rick Riordan wrote the Percy Jackson series for his son who also has dyslexia. Also, there are movies 
                    for the first 2-3 books. However, they are awful. I have not watched them because even Rick Riordan tells teachers 
                    not to show the movies to their students.
